# gitreview-extension
This is an extension i developed with a coworker to assist in reducing the amount of effort required to review our GraphQL pull requests. We have a large amount of generated files that come from Apollo when we make GraphQL changes and these don't always need reviewing, as such this extension will automatically mark __generated__ and schema files as viewed.
